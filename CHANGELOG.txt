# Dashboard Django Change Log

## 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Fixed database migration issue by applying pending migrations, resolving "no such table: core_dashboard_revenueentry" error
- Fixed UnboundLocalError for hours_fytd_goal and hours_mtd_goal by initializing them with default values before the try block in dashboard_view
- Fixed UnboundLocalError for partner_fytd_charged_hours and partner_mtd_charged_hours by initializing them with default values at the beginning of the partner specification section

### Added
- Created CHANGELOG.txt to document all code changes

### Notes
- The partner filtering issue was caused by uninitialized variables in the partner specification section
- All variables that could potentially be referenced outside their initialization scope have been properly initialized with default values
